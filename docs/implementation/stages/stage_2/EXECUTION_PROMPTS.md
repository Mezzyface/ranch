# Stage 2 Execution Prompts

## How to Use These Prompts
1. Copy the prompt exactly as written
2. Run preflight check first to ensure readiness
3. Execute tasks in the recommended order
4. Use validation prompts after each task completion

---

## üîç PREFLIGHT CHECK (Run First!)

```
Please run the Stage 2 preflight check to verify all prerequisites are met:

1. Run: godot --headless --scene tests/stage_2_preflight.gd
2. Review the output and address any failures or warnings
3. Ensure all Stage 1 tests pass: godot --headless --scene tests/test_all.tscn
4. Report the preflight results summary

Only proceed with Stage 2 implementation if the preflight check shows "READY FOR STAGE 2 IMPLEMENTATION".
```

3. Check for warnings in console
4. Verify performance meets targets
5. Ensure save/load integration works
6. Confirm SignalBus signals emit correctly

## üöÄ PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

### For Multiple Agents:

```
Agent 1: Please implement Stage 2 Task 1 (TimeSystem) following the documentation exactly.
Agent 2: Please implement Stage 2 Task 2 (UI Framework) following the documentation exactly.

Both agents should:
- Follow Stage 1 patterns
- Test after each file creation
- Use SignalBus for all signals
- Report completion status

After both complete, proceed with dependent tasks.
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING PROMPTS

### If Build Fails:

```
The build is failing. Please:
1. Show the exact error message
2. Check for missing files or typos
3. Verify all class_name declarations are correct
4. Ensure proper node paths in scenes
5. Fix the issue and test again
```

### If Tests Fail:

```
Tests are failing for [SYSTEM NAME]. Please:
1. Run the test with verbose output
2. Identify the specific assertion that fails
3. Add debug prints to trace the issue
4. Fix the bug and verify all tests pass
5. Ensure no regression in other tests
```

### If Performance Issues:

```
Performance target not met for [SYSTEM NAME]. Please:
1. Profile the slow operation
2. Identify bottlenecks with timers
3. Implement optimization (caching, batching, etc.)
4. Re-test performance
5. Document the optimization made
```
