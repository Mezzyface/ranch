## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **AgeSystem**: Trigger aging on week advancement
- **SaveSystem**: Persist time, stamina, food states
- **SignalBus**: Emit weekly update signals
- **PlayerCollection**: Display active/stable rosters
- **ResourceTracking**: Update gold/resources display
- **CreatureGenerator**: Test with generated populations

### New Signal Events
```gdscript
# TimeSystem signals
signal week_advanced(new_week: int)
signal month_completed(month: int)
signal year_completed(year: int)

# StaminaSystem signals
signal stamina_depleted(creature: CreatureData)
signal stamina_restored(creature: CreatureData, amount: int)

# FoodSystem signals
signal food_consumed(food_type: String, amount: int)
signal food_spoiled(food_type: String, amount: int)
signal food_shortage_warning()
```

## Performance Targets
- UI updates: <16ms per frame (60 FPS)
- Weekly update processing: <200ms for 100 creatures
- Scene transitions: <100ms
- Save/load with UI state: <300ms
- Memory usage: <100MB for UI resources

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Visual Design
- Clean, readable interface with clear hierarchy
- Consistent color coding for creature states
- Visual feedback for all interactions
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Accessibility considerations (font size, contrast)

### Interaction Patterns
- Single-click selection
- Double-click for details
- Drag-and-drop for organization
- Right-click context menus
- Keyboard navigation support

### Information Architecture
- Progressive disclosure (summary ‚Üí details)
- Contextual help tooltips
- Clear action consequences
- Undo/redo for critical actions
- Confirmation dialogs for time advancement

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- TimeSystem week calculations
- StaminaSystem depletion/restoration
- FoodSystem consumption logic
- Weekly update sequencing

### Integration Tests
- Full 52-week cycle progression
- Save/load with all UI state
- Multi-system weekly updates
- Performance under load

### UI Tests
- Responsiveness benchmarks
- Input handling validation
- Data binding accuracy
- Memory leak detection

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Advance through 52 weeks without errors
- [ ] All creatures age appropriately each week
- [ ] Stamina system depletes/restores correctly
- [ ] Food consumption matches creature requirements
- [ ] UI displays accurate real-time information
- [ ] Save/load preserves complete game state
- [ ] Performance targets met (60 FPS maintained)
- [ ] All Stage 2 signals properly integrated
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work as designed
- [ ] No memory leaks after extended play

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **UI Performance**: Use object pooling for creature cards
2. **Memory Management**: Implement proper cleanup on scene changes
3. **Save State Complexity**: Incremental save system for UI state
4. **Event Timing**: Clear event ordering and dependency management

### Design Risks
1. **UI Complexity**: Start minimal, iterate based on testing
2. **Time Pacing**: Ensure weekly progression feels meaningful
3. **Information Overload**: Progressive disclosure and tooltips
4. **Player Confusion**: Clear UI tutorials and help system

## Next Stage Preparation
Stage 2 completion enables:
- **Stage 3**: Shop system integration with UI
- **Stage 4**: Training UI and mechanics
- **Stage 5**: Quest system UI panels
- **Stage 6**: Competition participation UI

## Documentation Requirements
- Complete API documentation for all new systems
- UI component usage guide
- Keyboard shortcut reference
- Weekly update sequence diagram
- Performance profiling results

## Notes for AI Implementation
- Follow established patterns from Stage 1
- Maintain separation of data and behavior
- Use SignalBus for all cross-system communication
- Implement comprehensive validation and error handling
- Include debug modes for all systems
- Write tests concurrent with implementation
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
