# Quest Design Document: A Gem of a Problem (v2.0)

## Quest Line Overview

* **Quest Line Title:** A Gem of a Problem
* **Quest Giver:** Tim
* **Summary:** This quest line follows the escalating needs of **Tim**, a gem collector. The player will fulfill a series of orders by providing creatures that meet specific stat and tag-based criteria. This quest line serves as an extended tutorial, teaching the player to analyze a client's needs and select the appropriate creature from their collection, rather than simply following a set recipe.
* **Core Gameplay Loop:**
    1.  Receive a request from Tim with a list of required stats and tags.
    2.  Analyze the player's own collection of creatures to find a suitable match.
    3.  (If no match exists) Breed, tame, or train a creature to meet the criteria.
    4.  Deliver the qualifying creature(s) to Tim.
    5.  Receive rewards and unlock the next stage of the quest line.
