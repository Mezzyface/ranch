# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A creature collection/breeding game built with Godot 4.5. Currently implementing Stage 1 (Core Foundation) with basic GameCore autoload and SignalBus architecture completed. The game features creature collection, training, breeding, and quest completion through strategic creature management.

## Core Architecture (v2.0 - Improved)

### Game Systems
- **6 Core Stats**: STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, DIS (scale 1-1000)
- **Tag System**: Environmental, behavioral, physical, and utility tags for creature traits
- **Age System**: 5 age categories (Baby, Juvenile, Adult, Elder, Ancient) with performance modifiers
- **Time Management**: Weekly cycles for training, competitions, and aging
- **Resource Economy**: Gold currency, food requirements, creature acquisition through shops

### Data Architecture (Godot 4.5) - UPDATED
- **MVC Pattern**: Resources for data, Nodes for behavior, clear separation
- **Single GameCore**: One autoload managing subsystems (NOT multiple singletons)
- **SignalBus**: Centralized signal routing (Resources don't emit signals)
- **Flexible Save System**: ConfigFile for settings, ResourceSaver for complex data (NOT store_var)
- **Lazy Loading**: Subsystems and resources loaded on demand
- **Object Pooling**: UI elements reused for performance
- **Cache Management**: Handle Godot 4 resource cache bugs with workarounds

## Godot 4.5 Implementation Guidelines

### Key Godot 4.x Features to Use
- **Strong Typing**: Use typed GDScript (`var creature: Creature`, `func get_stats() -> Dictionary`)
- **@export Variables**: For inspector-configurable creature attributes and species templates
- **Custom Resources**: Extend Resource class for Creature, Species, Quest data models
- **Signal Bus Pattern**: Central signal manager for decoupled communication
- **Node Groups**: For managing creature collections and batch operations

### GDScript Best Practices - CRITICAL UPDATES
```gdscript
# CORRECT: Separate data from behavior
class_name CreatureData extends Resource  # Pure data, NO signals
@export var creature_name: String = ""
@export var stats: Dictionary = {}

class_name CreatureEntity extends Node  # Behavior and signals here
signal stats_changed(creature: CreatureData)
var data: CreatureData

# CORRECT: Use SignalBus for communication
SignalBus.creature_created.emit(creature_data)

# Save System Options (choose based on needs):
# Option 1: ConfigFile for simple data/settings
var config := ConfigFile.new()
config.set_value("creatures", id, creature.to_dict())
config.save("user://save.cfg")

# Option 2: ResourceSaver for complex Resources (Godot's native approach)
ResourceSaver.save(creature_data, "user://creature_%s.tres" % id)
# WARNING: Resources can contain scripts - validate loaded data!

# Resource Cache Workaround (Godot 4 bug):
# After saving:
resource.take_over_path(resource.resource_path)
# When loading:
ResourceLoader.load(path, "", ResourceLoader.CACHE_MODE_IGNORE)
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse creature instances for UI elements
- **Resource Preloading**: Cache frequently used species templates
- **Lazy Loading**: Load creature sprites only when visible
- **Dictionary Caching**: Store calculated stats to avoid recomputation
- **Signal Connections**: Prefer loaded Resources over .new() for reliable signals
- **Cache Invalidation**: Use take_over_path() after saving Resources to update cache

### Critical Godot 4.5 Gotchas
- Resources with signals can cause issues - keep data and behavior separate
- Use `take_over_path()` after saving Resources to handle cache bugs
- Prefer ConfigFile for settings, ResourceSaver for complex game data
- Always use typed GDScript for better performance and error checking

## Stage 1 Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ Task 1 (Project Setup) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
**Key Issues Discovered & Solutions:**

1. **Autoload Class Naming Conflict**
   - **Issue**: `class_name GameCore` conflicts with autoload singleton name
   - **Solution**: Remove `class_name` from autoload scripts, use `extends Node` only
   - **Why**: Godot 4.5 autoloads should not have class_name declarations

2. **Type Inference Warnings**
   - **Issue**: `var version := config.get_value()` causes Variant typing warnings
   - **Solution**: Use explicit typing: `var version: int = config.get_value()`
   - **Why**: Godot 4.5 treats warnings as errors in strict mode

3. **Input Map Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Input actions need proper modifier key settings in project.godot
   - **Solution**: Set `"ctrl_pressed":true` for Ctrl+key combinations manually
   - **Why**: Godot editor may not export modifier keys correctly to project file

4. **Lazy Loading Verification**
   - **Issue**: Systems won't load until first accessed, signals may not connect
   - **Solution**: Force system loading before emitting relevant signals
   - **Pattern**: `GameCore.get_system("save")` before `save_requested.emit()`

5. **Missing Placeholder Classes**
   - **Issue**: SignalBus references QuestData before it exists, causing parse errors
   - **Solution**: Create minimal placeholder Resource classes early
   - **Why**: GDScript requires all referenced types to exist for compilation

6. **Input Action Conflicts**
   - **Issue**: Multiple actions can map to same key (S for both shop and save)
   - **Solution**: Use modifiers properly - S for shop, Ctrl+S for save
   - **Testing**: Add debug prints to verify correct action triggering

7. **Unused Signal Warnings**
   - **Issue**: SignalBus declares all signals upfront, causing "never used" warnings
   - **Solution**: Comment out unused signals during early development, uncomment as needed
   - **Why**: Godot warns about declared but unused signals to prevent code bloat

8. **Tool Mode vs Runtime Testing**
   - **Issue**: `@tool` EditorScript can't access autoload methods (placeholder instance error)
   - **Solution**: Use regular Node with `_ready()` and scene for testing instead of EditorScript
   - **Pattern**: Create test.tscn scene with test script, run scene for integration testing

### Best Practices Established:
- **Always test compilation** after each script creation
- **Add debug output** for input and signal verification during development
- **Load systems explicitly** before emitting signals they need to handle
- **Use explicit typing** for all variables to avoid inference warnings
- **Create placeholder classes** for forward references immediately
- **Prefix unused parameters** with underscore (`_config`) to avoid warnings

### Verification Checklist for Future Tasks:
- [ ] No compilation errors in Godot console
- [ ] All referenced classes exist (even as placeholders)
- [ ] Input actions work as expected with debug output
- [ ] Systems load correctly when accessed
- [ ] Signals flow from source to destination with debug confirmation

## Stage 1 Task 2 Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ Task 2 (SignalBus Enhancement) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
**Key Achievements:**

1. **Enhanced Signal Architecture**
   - **Success**: Uncommented creature lifecycle signals while keeping unused signals commented
   - **Pattern**: Declare signals as needed, not all upfront to avoid unused warnings
   - **Result**: Clean console with expected "unused signal" warnings for future features

2. **Robust Connection Management**
   - **Success**: `connect_signal_safe()` and `disconnect_signal_safe()` with full validation
   - **Pattern**: Return boolean success values, track connections for debugging
   - **Result**: Bulletproof signal connections with comprehensive error handling

3. **Validated Signal Emission**
   - **Success**: Emission wrapper methods prevent invalid data from propagating
   - **Pattern**: Validate inputs before emission, use debug logging for verification
   - **Result**: Red error messages in console confirm validation works (this is good!)

4. **Debug System Architecture**
   - **Success**: Toggle debug mode, connection tracking, comprehensive logging
   - **Pattern**: Debug information helps during development, can be disabled in production
   - **Result**: Excellent visibility into signal flow for troubleshooting

### New Best Practices Established:
- **Signal validation is critical** - Never emit with null/invalid data
- **Connection tracking aids debugging** - Know what's connected where
- **Expected warnings are acceptable** - Yellow unused signal warnings are normal during development
- **Red validation errors are good** - They prove the system is protecting against bad data
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Test both success and failure cases
- **Debug logging during development** - Essential for verifying signal flow

### Updated Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Expected unused signal warnings (yellow) are acceptable
- [ ] Validation error messages (red) prove protection works
- [ ] Signal emissions work with valid data
- [ ] Connection management tracks properly
- [ ] Debug mode toggle functions correctly

## Stage 1 Task 2 Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ Task 2 (Creature Classes) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
**Key Achievements:**

1. **Perfect Data/Behavior Separation**
   - **Success**: CreatureData (Resource) contains only data, NO signals
   - **Success**: CreatureEntity (Node) handles all behavior and signal emission
   - **Validation**: Test confirms "CreatureData has NO signals (correct!)"

2. **Stat System Foundation**
   - **Success**: Stats clamp properly to 1-1000 range
   - **Success**: Stat accessors work with multiple names (STR/STRENGTH)
   - **Success**: Age modifiers calculate correctly

3. **Serialization Ready**
   - **Success**: to_dict() and from_dict() implemented
   - **Pattern**: Clean serialization without signals ensures save stability

4. **Signal Integration**
   - **Success**: All creature signals emit through centralized SignalBus
   - **Success**: Validation prevents null/invalid data emission
   - **Pattern**: Use SignalBus emit helpers for consistency

### New Best Practices from Task 2:
- **Array.erase() returns void in Godot 4** - Check existence first with has() methods
- **Resource setters work for clamping** - Use set(value) for automatic validation
- **Age categories use percentages** - More flexible than fixed age ranges
- **Performance scores need modifiers** - Age affects effective stats
- **Tag validation is critical** - Prevent invalid tags early
