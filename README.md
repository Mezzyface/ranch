## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Start with [Project Overview](docs/project/game.md)
   - Read [Stage 1 Overview](docs/implementation/stages/stage_1/00_stage_1_overview.md)

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install Godot 4.5
   - Clone this repository
   - Follow [Project Setup](docs/implementation/stages/stage_1/01_project_setup.md)

3. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with Stage 1 tasks in order
   - Each task has clear requirements and tests
   - Run tests after each task completion

### For Designers

1. **Understanding the Game**
   - Review [MVP Summary](docs/project/mvp_summary.md) for complete game overview
   - Explore system designs in `docs/design/systems/`
   - Check feature designs in `docs/design/features/`

2. **Quest Content**
   - See [Quest Design Doc](docs/design/content/quest_design_doc.md) for tutorial progression
   - Review [Quest System](docs/design/features/quest.md) for mechanics

## 📊 Development Progress

### Current Status: Stage 1 - Core Foundation
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Design specifications finalized
- [x] Implementation tasks defined
- [ ] Godot project created
- [ ] Core systems implemented
- [ ] Stage 1 testing complete

### Upcoming Stages
- **Stage 2**: Time Management & Basic UI (2 weeks)
- **Stage 3**: Shop System & Economy (2 weeks)
- **Stage 4**: Training System (2 weeks)
- **Stage 5**: Quest System - Tutorial Phase (2-3 weeks)
- **Stage 6**: Competition System (2 weeks)
- **Stage 7**: Advanced Quests (2-3 weeks)
- **Stage 8**: Breeding System (2 weeks)
- **Stage 9**: Polish & Additional Vendors (2 weeks)
- **Stage 10**: Balancing & MVP Completion (1-2 weeks)

**Total Timeline**: 19-24 weeks (4.5-6 months)

## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### Economic Balance
- **Starting Resources**: 500 gold + 2-3 starter creatures
- **Quest Profitability**: Net positive across tutorial (+4,690 gold total)
- **Income Sources**: Quests (primary) + Competitions (supplemental)

### Progressive Complexity
- **TIM-01/02**: Simple single-creature challenges
- **TIM-03/04**: Multi-creature coordination
- **TIM-05/06**: High-end challenges requiring premium creatures

### System Integration
- **Weekly Time Cycles**: All activities consume time
- **Food Requirements**: Active creatures need weekly food
- **Age Mechanics**: Creatures age affecting performance
- **Validation Systems**: Automatic requirement checking

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.5
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Architecture**: Component-based, Resource-driven
- **Version Control**: Git
